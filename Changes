* Added two new named colors: darkred and darkblue.
* Fixed a glitch that depends on Perl's interaction between $1/$2 and subs.
* Fixed a non-intuitive parser quirk that made e.g. links to CGI scripts
  "break" (i.e. need quoting/backslashes when it wasn't strictly necessary).

Thanks go to Alex Teslik <alex (AT) acatysmoof.com> for the bug report that
led to this release.
